				<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
				<p>
					Outside of school I enjoy:
					<ul>
						<li><dfn title="a form of free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses">Bouldering</dfn>. I really like the problem solving you have to do in order to figure out the more <q>technical</q> routes<br></li>
						<li>When I can, I also build mechanical keyboards. I can't do this too often though because:<br>
							<ol>
								<li>There are several parts I need to buy and some of them can take over a year to ship</li>
								<li>Some parts (like they case or the keycaps) can also be pretty expensive depending on the one you want to buy</li>
								<li>Putting together the keyboard properly can take several hours</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>I also play a variety of video games</li>
					</ul>
					I also have two cats: virgil and nero.
