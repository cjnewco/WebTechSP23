				<h3>Bouldering</h3>
				<p>
					To stay in shape I like to go bouldering, a type of rock climbing with shorter, but usually more technical routes, or "problems" as they are usually reffered to.
					The problems are graded on a V-scale from v1 to v17, but most indoor gyms don't have problems grade above v9, and those that do usually don't get above v11.
					As of now, I have completed a few v7's, but I think I could probably get an 8 right now if I tried one that suited my body type.
				</p>

				<p>
					I usually climb for about an hour and a half 3 days a week at <a href="https://armadilloboulders.com/">Armadillo Boulders</a>, and this is the main way I try and stay in shape.
