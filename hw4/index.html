				<h3>My Career Goals</h3>
				<p>
					My goal is to be a software engineer, areas that look interesting to me are:
					<ol>
						<li>Fullstack development</li>
						<li>Systems administration</li>
						<li>DevOps</li>
						<li>Web development</li>
					</ol>
					I also really like the spirit of open source software, and would like to contribute to projects in the future. I made an icon for <a href="https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar" target="_blank">one</a> but it would be nice to write some actual code.

				<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
				<p>
					Outside of school I enjoy:
					<ul>
						<li><dfn title="a form of free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses">Bouldering</dfn>. I really like the problem solving you have to do in order to figure out the more <q>technical</q> routes<br></li>
						<li>When I can, I also build mechanical keyboards. I can't do this too often though because:<br>
							<ol>
								<li>There are several parts I need to buy and some of them can take over a year to ship</li>
								<li>Some parts (like they case or the keycaps) can also be pretty expensive depending on the one you want to buy</li>
								<li>Putting together the keyboard properly can take several hours</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>I also play a variety of video games</li>
					</ul>
					I also have two cats: virgil and nero.
