	<h3>My Career Goals</h3>
  	<p>
		My goal is to be a software engineer, areas that look interesting to me are:
		<ol>
			<li>Fullstack development</li>
			<li>Systems administration</li>
			<li>DevOps</li>
			<li>Web development</li>
		</ol>
		I also really like the spirit of open source software, and would like to contribute to projects in the future. I made an icon for <a href="https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar">one</a> but it would be nice to write some actual code.
	</p>
  	<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
 	<p>
		Outside of school I enjoy:
		<ul>
			<li><dfn title="a form of free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses">Bouldering</dfn>. I really like the problem solving you have to do in order to figure out the more <q>technical</q> routes<br></li>
			<li>When I can, I also build mechanical keyboards. I can't do this too often though because:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>There are several parts I need to buy and some of them can take over a year to ship</li>
					<li>Some parts (like they case or the keycaps) can also be pretty expensive depending on the one you want to buy</li>
					<li>Putting together the keyboard properly can take several hours</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>I also play a variety of video games</li>
		</ul>
		I also have two cats: virgil and nero.
