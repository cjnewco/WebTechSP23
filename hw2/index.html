	</p>
  	<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
 	<p>
		Outside of school I enjoy <dfn title="a form of free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses">bouldering</dfn>, to stay in shape. I really like the problem solving you have to do in order to figure out the more <q>technical</q> routes<br>
 		When I can, I also build mechanical keyboards. I can't do this very often though because they can get expensive pretty quickly, and it can take over a year for the parts to show up in the mail.
